## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, addressed by sparse/low-rank attention and FlashAttention. Discusses diminishing returns with large context windows through data biasing (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA). Notes Transformers excel at token correlation but struggle with reasoning, highlighting the need for approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects & Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and popular GitHub repositories like Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on advancements in AI development.
