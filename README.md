## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This learning content covers diffusion models, highlighting their state-of-the-art performance compared to latent space methods like VAEs and GANs. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This learning content explores limitations of Transformers, including quadratic memory complexity addressable by sparse/approximate attention (e.g., Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows tackled by recency biasing (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and the challenge of reasoning tasks, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) emerging as a solution.

- **Opal and LLM Repositories** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including Graphrag Toolkit.
