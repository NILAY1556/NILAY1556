## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art, surpassing VAEs and GANs in performance, and learning about Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technology within this context.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzing Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (solved by biasing recent data, selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning capabilities (enhanced by Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve symbolic thinking beyond statistical correlation).

- **AI Project & Tool Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
