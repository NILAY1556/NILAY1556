## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, addressed by sparse/approximate attention (Flash Attention). Discusses diminishing returns with large context windows through data biasing (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and the need for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning beyond statistical correlation.

- **Exploring AI Projects & Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for insights into AI applications and development.
