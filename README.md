## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explore diffusion models, the current state-of-the-art in generative AI surpassing VAEs and GANs, and understand Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced sequence processing.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity and diminishing returns with large context windows. Discusses solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention, and techniques for biasing recent data or selective attention in models like MEGA, LaMDA, and CEMA. Also touches on reasoning tasks and the emergence of CoT.

- **Explore AI Project & Repos** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, for insights into AI development and applications.
