## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores Diffusion Models, a state-of-the-art technique surpassing previous GAN and VAE-based latent space methods, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores the limitations of Transformers including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing, weight updates like MEGA, and selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks (contrasted with statistical correlation, leading to approaches like Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories including GraphRag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, covering advancements and applications in AI.
