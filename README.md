## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, their superiority over VAEs and GANs, and the application of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced performance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large contexts, and challenges with reasoning. Discusses solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash attention, biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for enhanced reasoning.

- **Exploring LLM Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and significant GitHub repositories such as graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, gaining insights into LLM applications.
