## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This learning content covers diffusion models, noting their advancement beyond VAEs and GANs to become state-of-the-art. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content explores Transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention and FlashAttention, diminishing returns with large context windows solved by biasing recent data (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and the challenges in reasoning tasks, leading to Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Explore AI Tools and Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewing Google DeepMind's Opal project and key GitHub repositories such as graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps to understand their functionality and applications in AI.
