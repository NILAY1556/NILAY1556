## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/low-rank attention, FlashAttention) and diminishing returns with large context windows. Solutions involve biasing recent data (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA). Reasoning tasks highlight statistical correlation over symbolic thinking, leading to techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring LLM Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and relevant GitHub repositories, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, to understand LLM applications.
