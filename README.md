## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content explores Diffusion Models, which have become state-of-the-art, surpassing VAEs and GANs. It also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/low-rank attention, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency bias, selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning/symbolic thinking (pointing towards Chain-of-Thought).

- **Deepmind AI & LLM Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
