## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content covers Diffusion Models, noting their rise to state-of-the-art performance surpassing latent space methods like VAEs and GANs. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a related technology.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by Flash Attention, diminishing returns with large context windows via biasing recent data or selective attention (MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning tasks improved with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for symbolic thinking beyond statistical correlation.

- **AI Project and Tool Exploration** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for AI development.
