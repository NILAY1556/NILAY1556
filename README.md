## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models with RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores Diffusion Models, the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, building upon concepts like latent space, VAEs, and GANs. Features Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced performance.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency bias and selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning tasks (where statistical correlation excels but symbolic thinking is addressed by techniques like Chain-of-Thought).

- **DeepMind, LLMs, and GraphRAG** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
