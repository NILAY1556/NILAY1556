## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models, the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, contrasting them with earlier methods like VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced performance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations such as quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention and Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing like MEGA, and selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **AI Project & Tool Exploration** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project, reviewed the Graphrag-toolkit GitHub repository, and examined awesome-llm-apps for advanced AI application development.
