## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs. It also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for encoding positional information in models.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/approximate attention, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (managed by data biasing, selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning challenges (where Chain-of-Thought, CoT, emerges).

- **DeepMind Opal and LLM Repositories** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, providing insights into LLM applications and tools.
