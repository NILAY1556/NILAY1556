## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and learning about Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for improved sequence representation.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzing Transformers' limitations including: quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Discussing solutions like sparse/approximate attention, biasing toward recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Google DeepMind & LLM Tooling** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories for LLM application development, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps.
