## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data, selective attention like MEGA and LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning task challenges (where statistical correlation falls short of symbolic thinking, leading to CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and curated key GitHub repositories including the Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on advancements in AI applications and development.
