## Exploring...
- **Advanced Deep Learning Architectures** (19-08-25)
  Explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and Diffusion Models, highlighting their state-of-the-art performance in deep learning, surpassing previous latent space, VAE, and GAN models.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes the limitations of Transformers, including quadratic memory complexity (addressable with sparse/low-rank attention and Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data, weight updates like MEGA, or selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks beyond statistical correlation, suggesting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as a solution.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and significant GitHub repositories such as graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps for LLM applications.
