## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, addressed by sparse/approximate attention and FlashAttention. Discusses diminishing returns with large contexts via recency biasing (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA). Highlights transformer's statistical correlation ability for reasoning tasks and the need for techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Project Opal** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and relevant GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on AI and LLM applications.
