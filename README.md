## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores the advancement of diffusion models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing latent space techniques like VAEs and GANs. It also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Discusses solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for symbolic reasoning.

- **AI Project & Repo Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and curated key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
