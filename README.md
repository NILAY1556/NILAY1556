## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content explores diffusion models, positioning them as state-of-the-art successors to VAEs and GANs in latent space. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technology.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (solved by recency bias, selective attention like MEGA and LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (highlighting statistical correlation and leading to CoT for symbolic thinking).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and popular GitHub repositories, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, to understand current AI applications and development resources.
