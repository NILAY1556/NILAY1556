## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explore diffusion models as state-of-the-art alternatives to latent space VAEs and GANs. Learn about Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced contextual understanding within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by data biasing, selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning deficits (addressed by Chain-of-Thought prompting for symbolic thinking).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories such as Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into AI development and applications.
