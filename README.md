## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Learn about Diffusion models, which are now state-of-the-art, surpassing previous leaders like VAEs and GANs in the latent space. This also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores limitations of Transformers including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Discusses solutions like Flash Attention, MEGA, CEMA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved performance and capabilities.

- **Opal, LLM Apps, and Graph RAG** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, for insights into LLM application development.
