## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content introduces diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous VAE and GAN architectures. It also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE), a technique used within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and reasoning task challenges. Solutions discussed include sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored GitHub repositories for AI applications, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
