## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This learning content focuses on Diffusion Models, highlighting their advancement beyond VAEs and GANs as the current State-of-the-Art. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention and low-rank approximation (Flash Attention); diminishing returns with large context windows via recency bias (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA); and challenges in reasoning tasks, leading to techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for symbolic thinking.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, for practical AI applications.
