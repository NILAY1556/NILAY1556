## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explore diffusion models as the state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs. Understand their application alongside Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced contextual understanding in AI.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, or FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data, weight updates, or selective attention mechanisms), and reasoning task challenges (leading to Chain-of-Thought prompting).

- **Exploring LLM Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
