## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art, surpassing VAEs and GANs. Discusses Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and its application within this framework.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project and key GitHub repositories, including the Graphrag Toolkit and awesome-llm-apps.
