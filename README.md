## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content covers Diffusion Models, highlighting their superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods like VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning task challenges. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and valuable GitHub repositories such as Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into cutting-edge AI development.
