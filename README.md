## Exploring...
- **Advanced AI Embeddings & Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and Diffusion models, highlighting their advancement beyond previous generative AI techniques like VAEs and GANs in latent space.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity (addressable by sparse attention/low-rank approximation/FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing/weight updates or selective attention), and reasoning tasks (where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) surpasses statistical correlations).

- **Exploring AI Tools & Repos** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored GitHub repositories like graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps for LLM applications.
