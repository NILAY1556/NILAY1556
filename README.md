## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs. Covers latent space concepts and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technique.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed include sparse/approximate attention (FlashAttention), biasing recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Tools and Repositories** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on advancements in LLM applications.
