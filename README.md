## Exploring...
- **RoPE and Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and diffusion models, highlighting the shift in state-of-the-art from VAEs and GANs to diffusion models within the context of latent space.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores limitations of Transformers like quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and reasoning challenges. Discusses solutions including sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for enhanced reasoning.

- **AI Project & Tool Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into AI development and application.
