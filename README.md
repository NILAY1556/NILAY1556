## Exploring...
- **Understanding Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  This learning content covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and the advancement of Diffusion Models, which are now State-of-the-Art, surpassing previous latent space models like VAEs and GANs.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data, weight updates, and selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning tasks (where transformers excel at token correlation but require techniques like CoT for symbolic thinking).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on advancements in AI development and application.
