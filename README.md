## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores the application of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) within diffusion models, highlighting their superiority over previous state-of-the-art generative models like VAEs and GANs in latent space manipulation.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, addressed by sparse attention or Flash Attention. Also covers diminishing returns with large context windows, tackled by biasing recent data (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA). Addresses reasoning limitations by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for symbolic thinking beyond statistical correlation.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project and GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on AI development and resources.
