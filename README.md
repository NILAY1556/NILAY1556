## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse/low-rank attention (e.g., FlashAttention); diminishing returns with large context windows mitigated by recency bias (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA); and reasoning challenges, highlighting the need for approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **AI Project and GitHub Reviews** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on AI applications and tools.
