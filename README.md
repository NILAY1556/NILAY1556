## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context (solved by biasing recent data, selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (highlighting statistical correlation vs. symbolic thinking, leading to CoT).

- **Reviewing AI Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored notable GitHub repositories such as graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps.
