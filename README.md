## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art, surpassing previous methods like VAEs and GANs. Also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity (addressable by sparse attention or FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (managed by recency bias or selective attention like MEGA and CEMA), and reasoning capabilities (limited statistical correlation, prompting Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring LLM Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and GitHub repositories including Graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on advancements in LLM applications.
