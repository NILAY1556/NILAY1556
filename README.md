## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models: State-of-the-Art** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, which have become state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous kingpins like VAEs and GANs, by exploring concepts such as latent space and RoPE.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzing Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data, weight updates like MEGA, and selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (where statistical correlation is strong, but symbolic thinking requires approaches like Chain-of-Thought).

- **Opal, LLM Apps, GraphRAG** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project, reviewed useful GitHub repositories including GraphRAG Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
