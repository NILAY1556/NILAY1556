## Exploring...
- **Understanding RoPE & Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and the dominance of Diffusion Models in generative AI, noting their advancement beyond VAEs and GANs.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes limitations of Transformers, including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project, alongside exploration of valuable GitHub repositories including GraphRag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
