## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technique within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations such as quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/approximate attention, FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large contexts (mitigated by recency bias, selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning deficits (where Chain-of-Thought improves symbolic thinking beyond statistical correlation).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
