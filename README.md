## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding Diffusion Models, including their latent space and comparison to VAEs and GANs, alongside Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzing Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (addressed by biasing recent data/weight updates like MEGA, or selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (requiring techniques like Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring AI Tools and Repos** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project. Explored key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for AI development and application insights.
