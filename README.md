## Exploring...
- **Advanced Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores Diffusion Models as the state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous VAE and GAN techniques. Discusses Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced positional understanding within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency bias, weight updates via MEGA, and selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (where statistical correlation falls short, leading to techniques like Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored valuable GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into new AI technologies and applications.
