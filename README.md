## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, their advantages over VAEs and GANs, and the role of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) in their architecture.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and challenges with reasoning tasks, offering solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and useful GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into current AI development and applications.
