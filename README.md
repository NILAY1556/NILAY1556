## Exploring...
- **Advanced Deep Learning Models** (19-08-25)
  This learning content covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and Diffusion models. It highlights Diffusion models as the current State-of-the-Art (SoTA), surpassing previous dominant architectures like VAEs and GANs in the latent space.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes limitations of Transformer models: quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed include sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and valuable GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, gaining insights into current AI development and applications.
