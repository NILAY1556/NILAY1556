## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse/low-rank attention (FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows mitigated by recency bias (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning task challenges tackled by techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects & Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and beneficial GitHub repositories such as Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps to understand current AI developments.
