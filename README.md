## Exploring...
- **Understanding Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, superseding latent space, VAEs, and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations like quadratic memory, diminishing returns with large contexts, and reasoning gaps. Discusses solutions including sparse/approximate attention (FlashAttention), biasing recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought for enhanced reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and GitHub repositories like Graphrag-Toolkit and Awesome-LLM-Apps, focusing on advanced AI applications and development resources.
