## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, superseding VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component for handling positional information within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Discusses solutions like sparse attention, approximate low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring Generative AI Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, for generative AI applications.
