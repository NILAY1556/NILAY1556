## Exploring...
- **Understanding Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the state-of-the-art approach in generative AI, building upon concepts like latent space, VAEs, and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technology.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention/FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (managed by recency bias/selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning challenges (addressed by Chain-of-Thought prompting).

- **Opal and LLM Resource Review** (29-07-25)
  Explores Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviews key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for LLM application development.
