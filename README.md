## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technology within this domain.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing, weight updates, and selective attention like MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks beyond statistical correlations, highlighting the need for approaches like Chain-of-Thought.

- **Opal, Graphrag, LLM Apps** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project. Explored key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps for insights into large language model applications.
