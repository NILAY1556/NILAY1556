## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, which have surpassed VAEs and GANs as state-of-the-art, and exploring Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning task challenges. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **AI Project and Tool Review** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps for LLM application development.
