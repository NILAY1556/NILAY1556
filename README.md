## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding Diffusion Models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous methods like VAEs and GANs, and exploring Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed involve sparse/approximate attention (Flash Attention), biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought for reasoning.

- **AI Project & Tool Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit, to understand emerging AI technologies and development resources.
