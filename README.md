## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, their advancement beyond VAEs and GANs as State-of-the-Art, and the role of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) in their operation.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by biasing recent data or selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks beyond statistical correlation (highlighted by Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring LLM Tools & Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and significant GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on advancements in LLM applications.
