## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models: SoTA** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art, building upon concepts of latent space, VAEs, and GANs that previously dominated generative AI.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention, biasing towards recent data, selective attention mechanisms (MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and curated GitHub repositories focusing on LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
