## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, their advantages over VAEs and GANs, and the implementation of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced performance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention and Flash Attention; diminishing returns with large contexts improved by recency biasing (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA); and reasoning task improvements through techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects & Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, focusing on AI applications.
