## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This learning content focuses on understanding diffusion models, which have surpassed previous state-of-the-art methods like VAEs and GANs in performance, and explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technology within this domain.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and struggles with reasoning tasks. Solutions explored include sparse/low-rank attention, biased recent data weighting (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project and notable GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, offering insights into cutting-edge AI applications and development resources.
