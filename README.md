## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art for generative tasks, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technique.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by FlashAttention, diminishing returns in large contexts via biasing/selective attention (MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning challenges requiring techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project, and explored significant GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
