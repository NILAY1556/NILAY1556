## Exploring...
- **Understanding RoPE and Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Learn about RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) and diffusion models, highlighting the shift from VAEs/GANs to diffusion models as the state-of-the-art, particularly within the context of latent space.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/approximate attention, FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context (biasing recent data, selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning tasks (statistical correlation vs. symbolic thinking, leading to CoT).

- **Opal and LLM Repositories** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories such as Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on advancements in LLM applications and tools.
