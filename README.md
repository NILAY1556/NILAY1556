## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models as state-of-the-art alternatives to VAEs and GANs, and exploring Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and reasoning deficits. Solutions explored are sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved performance.

- **Reviewing AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and analyzed key GitHub repositories, including GraphRag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, for practical AI application insights.
