## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. It explores solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and the role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Reviewing AI Projects & Repos** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the Graphrag Toolkit.
