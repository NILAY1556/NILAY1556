## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores Diffusion models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous techniques like VAEs and GANs. Also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced model performance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Explores solutions such as sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT).

- **AI Project and Tool Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps for insights into LLM applications.
