## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding Diffusion Models, including their latent space and how they have surpassed VAEs and GANs as state-of-the-art, alongside the implementation of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzing Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed involve sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash Attention, biasing toward recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Explore AI Projects & Tools** (29-07-25)
  Review of Google DeepMind's Opal project and exploration of key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including Graphrag Toolkit.
