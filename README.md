## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, superseding previous leaders like VAEs and GANs. It also covers Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE), a technique enhancing positional information within models.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations, including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/low-rank attention, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency bias, selective attention like MEGA and LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning task challenges (requiring techniques like Chain-of-Thought for symbolic thinking).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and significant GitHub repositories, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps, for insights into LLM applications.
