## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content explores diffusion models, surpassing VAEs and GANs as state-of-the-art, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technology within this domain.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/approximate attention, FlashAttention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing, selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning beyond statistical correlation (highlighting the need for CoT).

- **Google DeepMind & LLM Tooling** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories for Large Language Model applications, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps.
