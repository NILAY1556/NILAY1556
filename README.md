## Exploring...
- **Understanding RoPE and Diffusion Models** (19-08-25)
  Explores Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and its application in diffusion models. Discusses how diffusion models have become state-of-the-art, surpassing previous techniques like VAEs and GANs in the latent space.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity (addressable via sparse/low-rank attention, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large contexts (mitigated by recency bias, selective attention like MEGA/LaMDA/CEMA), and reasoning capabilities (requiring Chain-of-Thought for symbolic tasks).

- **Explore AI & LLM Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal and key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome-LLM-Apps.
