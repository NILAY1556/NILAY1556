## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores diffusion models, a state-of-the-art generative approach, and their integration with Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) to enhance understanding within latent spaces, moving beyond previous GAN and VAE dominance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores the limitations of Transformers, including quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse attention, low-rank approximation, and Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows (mitigated by recency biasing, weight updates like MEGA, and selective attention like LaMDA/CEMA), and challenges in reasoning tasks (addressed by techniques like Chain-of-Thought).

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and curated GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, focusing on practical AI applications.
