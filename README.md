## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content explores diffusion models, highlighting their advancement beyond latent space, VAEs, and GANs to achieve state-of-the-art results. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key component.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning task challenges. Solutions discussed include sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and beneficial GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
