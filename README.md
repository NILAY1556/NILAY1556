## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, addressed by sparse attention or low-rank approximation, and diminishing returns with large context windows. Solutions involve biasing towards recent data, selective attention patterns, and the use of CoT for reasoning tasks.

- **AI Project & Resource Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories including Graphrag-Toolkit and Awesome-LLM-Apps for AI application development.
