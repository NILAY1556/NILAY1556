## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention and low-rank approximation (FlashAttention); diminishing returns with large context windows via recency biasing (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA); and limitations in reasoning tasks, pointing towards approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **AI Project & Repo Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored key GitHub repositories, including Graphrag-Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, to understand current AI applications.
