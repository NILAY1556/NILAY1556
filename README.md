## Exploring...
- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention/low-rank approximation (Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context windows via recency bias (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning task limitations countered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

- **AI Project & GitHub Review** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and explored GitHub repositories for AI applications, including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps.
