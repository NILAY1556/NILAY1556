## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and exploring the application of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) within this context.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analysis of Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity addressed by Flash Attention, diminishing returns with large context windows mitigated by recency biasing (MEGA) and selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and reasoning task challenges, leading to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

- **Exploring AI Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal, a new AI project. Explored relevant GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps.
