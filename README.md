## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models, which have surpassed VAEs and GANs as state-of-the-art, and their integration with Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced performance.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context, and reasoning capabilities. Solutions include sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Exploring LLM Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and valuable GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for understanding and building with large language models.
