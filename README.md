## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This learning content covers diffusion models, highlighting their emergence as state-of-the-art compared to previous methods like GANs and VAEs in latent space. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a key technique.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Analyzes Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity (addressed by sparse/approximate attention, Flash Attention), diminishing returns with large context (solved by biasing recent data, selective attention), and reasoning tasks (improved by CoT for symbolic thinking).

- **Opal, Graphrag, LLM Apps** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project, reviewed the Graphrag Toolkit GitHub repository, and examined exemplary LLM applications.
