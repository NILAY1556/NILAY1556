## Exploring...
- **Understanding RoPE and Diffusion** (19-08-25)
  Explore Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and Diffusion models, noting the shift from VAEs and GANs to Diffusion as the state-of-the-art in generative modeling.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores transformer limitations like quadratic memory complexity (addressable with sparse/low-rank attention, Flash Attention) and diminishing returns with large contexts (addressed by recency bias, selective attention). It also notes transformers' strength in statistical correlation over reasoning tasks, highlighting Chain-of-Thought as a solution for the latter.

- **Exploring AI Projects and Tools** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and key GitHub repositories including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps for insights into AI development.
