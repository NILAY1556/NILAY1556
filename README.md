## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Explores Diffusion Models as state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing VAEs and GANs, and introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) for enhanced positional encoding within these models.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and reasoning task challenges. Discusses solutions like sparse attention, low-rank approximation, FlashAttention, biasing on recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **AI Project Exploration** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories including graphrag-toolkit and awesome-llm-apps to understand advancements in AI applications and tooling.
