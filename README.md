## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding Diffusion Models, their advancement over VAEs and GANs in latent space, and the implementation of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  Explores Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large contexts, and challenges in reasoning. Solutions discussed include sparse/low-rank attention (FlashAttention), context biasing (MEGA, LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought prompting for symbolic reasoning.

- **DeepMind, GraphRAG, LLM Apps** (29-07-25)
  Explored Google DeepMind's Opal project and reviewed key GitHub repositories for LLM applications, including the GraphRAG Toolkit.
