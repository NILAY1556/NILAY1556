## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models & RoPE** (19-08-25)
  Understanding diffusion models as the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, surpassing previous methods like VAEs and GANs, and exploring the implementation of Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) within these architectures.

- **Transformer Limitations and Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes limitations of Transformer models including quadratic memory complexity, diminishing returns with large context windows, and challenges in reasoning tasks. Solutions discussed include sparse attention, low-rank approximation, Flash attention, biasing towards recent data (MEGA), selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for improved reasoning.

- **Deepmind, GraphRAG, LLM Apps** (29-07-25)
  Explores Google DeepMind's Opal project and analyzes key GitHub repositories such as Graphrag-Toolkit and Awesome-LLM-Apps.
