## Exploring...
- **Diffusion Models and RoPE** (19-08-25)
  This content explores Diffusion Models, noting their current state-of-the-art status and contrasting them with previous leaders like VAEs and GANs in the latent space. It also introduces Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) as a related concept.

- **Transformer Limitations & Solutions** (30-07-25)
  This content analyzes Transformer limitations: quadratic memory complexity addressed by sparse attention or Flash Attention; diminishing returns with large context windows mitigated by biasing recent data (MEGA) or selective attention (LaMDA, CEMA); and reasoning task limitations overcome by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for symbolic thinking beyond statistical correlations.

- **Reviewing AI Projects** (29-07-25)
  Reviewed Google DeepMind's Opal project and key GitHub repositories, including Graphrag Toolkit and Awesome LLM Apps, to understand current AI project landscape.
